# Vno - Jekyll

[Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno), which is originally developed from [Dale Anthony's Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno).

## Live Demo

See [Vno - Jekyll](http://vno.onevcat.com) site and [my blog](http://onevcat.com).

You can also find some instruction as well as other sites using Vno theme in [this page](http://vno.onevcat.com/2016/02/hello-world-vno/).

## Licence

Great thanks to [Dale Anthony](https://github.com/daleanthony) and his [Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno). Vno Jekyll is based on Uno, and contains a lot of modification on page layout, animation, font and some more things I can not remember.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/oolongoo/Han-Chiang.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
